				<p>During my childhood, one of my favorite things to do was to play video games. To this day I still play video games very often, and I've finally reached a point where I feel like I've played enough games to make a genuine list of my top 10 favorite games of all time. Throughout this list, I attempted to keep it as diverse as possible by not reusing any video game series. I placed this restriction because otherwise my list would be rather boring as it would only be full of The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, and Dragon Quest. Before I get started I would like to give a few honorable mentions:</p>
				<ul> 
					<li>Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest</li>
					<li>DOOM (1993)</li>
					<li>Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride</li>
					<li>Hollow Knight</li>
					<li>Mega Man X</li>
					<li>Mega Man ZX Advent</li>
					<li>Pokemon Black 2</li>
					<li>Super Metroid</li>
					<li>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD</li>
					<li>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Now that the introduction is out of the way, I will be starting with my 10<sup>th</sup> favorite video game of all time!</p>

				<h1 class="video-game-header">10. Hades</h1>
				<img src="images/hades.jpg" alt="Hades" class="video-game-images" style="float: right; clear: both;"/>
				<p>Hades was not a game that I would be expected to have played. I've never been interested in the roguelite genre as I don't see the appeal of doing hundreds of runs without anything of substance occurring such as story progression. However, Hades goes against most roguelites and provides meaningful changes after each of its runs until you've fully completed the story and every side quest. The reason that this is so important is because it incentivizes you to keep playing the game. You play to see what happens to each character, to see how certain situations pan out, and to just see the ending of the game.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Not only does the game make you want to play because of its story, but its gameplay does as well. The controls are essentially five things. You have a default attack and a special attack for your weapon. Then you have a dash to dodge enemies, a cast which lets you use spells, and a call for a God to assist you. Throughout the run you can enhance each of these parts of your toolkit to become stronger by getting boons from various Gods from Mount Olympus. In the case of the call, it is required that you get a boon first before you can even use it. Each God has their own gimmick which gives you countless combinations that you can try out throughout the game. My overall favorite boons were from Zeus and Dionysus, because I enjoyed how the former became very strong if you kept picking his boons, while the latter was strong if you combined his boons with those of the other Gods. The weapon diversity in the game is pretty good as well, as you have six distinct ones that you can utilize, albeit that you only start with the Stygian Blade and have to unlock the other five. On top of these six weapons, each has three other forms that can be unlocked which changes how you play. Personally speaking, my favorite weapon in the game was the Aspect of Rama, which allows you to shoot in three directions with your default attack and tag multiple enemies with your special. Tagging enemies allows you to hit all of them when using your default attack, even if you only hit one enemy. After completing your first ever run, you are able to make the game more difficult with various conditions which creates even more gameplay diversity. The core gameplay is basic, but it works very well due to how much can be changed to keep every run interesting and fun.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Due to Hades being a rougelite, there is a way to permanently increase the capabilities of your character, Zagreus. This can be done by going to Zagreus's bedroom and activating the "Mirror of Night". From here you are able to unlock many different capabilities such as an extra dash, more health, and even a revive when you die. I feel like this was one of the strongest aspects of the game because if you were you still had something to look forward to all the time: upgrading yourself and becoming stronger. This feature was very motivating for me, and helped push me to keep playing until I completed my first ever run. Without this feature, I think that I would either not like this game as much as I do or would have dropped it completely.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Even though I don't typically enjoy the rougelite genre, Hades was a game that completely capitvated me. I enjoyed playing through so I could see the plot and side quests unfold. The gameplay stayed fun the entire time due to the amount of diversity implemented through boons, weapons, and difficulty options. Being able to upgrade your character was the cherry on top to motivate you to keep playing even if you were struggling. Hades is a superb game that I would recommend to anyone as I enjoyed it to completion even though it's from a genre I don't like.</p>

				<h1 class="video-game-header">8. Super Mario Odyssey</h1>
				<img src="images/superMarioOdyssey.jpg" alt="Super Mario Odyssey" class="video-game-images" style="float: right; clear: both;"/>
				<p> Super Mario Odyssey is my favorite Mario game of all time. However, I do have to admit that I have yet to play Super Mario World and Super Mario Galaxy 2. With that said, what I think makes Super Mario Odyssey so great are three major things: the controls of the game, the captures that you use to transform, and the amount of Power Moons to collect.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>The controls of this game allows Mario to be as free as can be in terms of how he moves. Mario's basic movement keeps many staples from previous games such as his long jump, triple jump, and backflip. None of these things are stand out differences from previous games, so why is Mario Odyssey's movement so good? The answer is because of Mario's companion Cappy, who serves as his hat for the game. Cappy allows Mario to do many maneuvers that he previously could not. For example, Mario can now perform a sideways somersault, throw his hat, dive towards his hat, land on his hat, and then roll quickly along the floor in a matter of a few seconds. This makes traversing across all the different areas in the game constantly fun and engaging because you can move so quickly that you don't care if something is really far away.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>A staple of Mario games are the power ups that Mario can use such as the well known Fire Flower. Mario Odyssey takes a very unique approach to Mario's power ups by allowing Mario to transform after capturing an animal, enemy, or object with Cappy. What this allows for is copious amounts of abilities that you can access at any given time from the environment. I think that the greatest strength of this system is the fact that you can make so many power ups without having to create new items. Rather than creating some item that allows you to be a frog, you can capture a frog and become it. This simple mechanic allows the game to become much more diverse than it otherwise would be with Mario's normal power up system.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>The amount of Power Moons in the game is a topic of controversy when it comes to Mario Odyssey. Throughout the game, you are able to collect 880 unique Power Moons, and you need these collectables in order to access different locations in the game. One side says that there are too many and the amount should be reduced, while the other states that the amount of moons is perfectly fine. Personally, I agree with the latter, and in fact think that the decision to have so many moons actually enhances the game. I think that the strongest argument for keeping all of the moons is that it allows for a superior amount of replayability compared to a game with less moons. Once you beat the game and put it down, you can continue collecting hundreds of Power Moons across the various worlds, or you can start a new playthrough and collect the moons in an entirely different order than your first time. It's essential for this game to have as many moons as it does because it incentivizes you play the game more at some point later down the road.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Overall, I think that Super Mario Odyssey is easily Mario's best adventure yet. It has fast-paced action, plenty of unique transformations which act as power ups, and many collectables all over the world. This is a great game that any Mario fan or 3D platforming fan should experience.</p>

				<h1 class="video-game-header">7. Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age - Definitive Edition</h1>
				<img src="images/dragonQuestXI.jpg" alt="Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age - Definitive Edition" class="video-game-images" style="float: left; clear: both;"/>
				<p>Dragon Quest XI is a game that I expected to enjoy as I'm a fan of the Dragon Quest series. What I did not expect was that it would hook me to the point that the only thing I did during my free time was play it until I completed all three acts and every side quest. I loved everything about this game. To pick a few things to talk about, I would say my favorite parts of this game were the characters, the world, and the second act.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Every single major character in this game is absolutely fantastic. The main party members in this game are Erik, Veronica, Serena, Sylvando, Jade, Rab. Erik is the cool thief who becomes your first party member. Veronica and Serena are twins where the former is adamant about what she wants to do, while the latter is much more reserved and goes along with what her sister wants to do. Sylvando is a man who strives to makes the whole world smile. Rab is the main character's grandfather who is a former king (as well as a perv), and Jade is a princess who helped the main character survive when they were a baby. Now, I know that all of this sounds very basic, and it is. However, the execution of each character throughout the game is expertly done via cutscenes, party dialogue, and plot developments. An example off the top of my head that illustrates this is from the very beginning of the game, where you and Erik attempt to escape from Heliodor Castle's dungeon after you have been imprisoned by King Carnelian for being the Luminary, whom he believes is the cause of calamity instead of the savior of the world. At the end of the escape you are cornered by Helidor's guards on the edge of a cliff with no way to escape except by jumping off into the water below. Erik then turns to you and says "Let's do this. I believe in you. I believe in the Luminary...I don't have much choice". Both of you then, together, at the same time, jump into the water at the bottom of the cliff. To keep this section from rambling on too much about the characters, I would like to give a shoutout to Jasper and Hendrik, who are knights of Heliodor and play important roles throughout the entire game. The characters of Dragon Quest XI all have their own charm to them, and you become more attached to each of them as the story unfolds and you see all of their struggles and interactions.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Erdrea is the name of Dragon Quest XI's world, and it is a joy to explore. Once you set out into the world after the opening sequence, you are given a horse, which helps tremendously in traveling across the world. The game isn't open world, but it gives you plenty of areas that you can explore when you reach different sections of the game, which allows you to choose to do things other than the main story. I love how each area in the game is so distinct from one another. For example, Heliodor is your standard kingdom that you would envision as soon as you think about a kingdom, but then there are areas like Octagonia, which is a town that is all about their masked martial arts tournament (and later gambling). Another thing that makes exploring Erdrea so fun is that you can choose to fight which monsters you want to. This helps keep the flow of exploration strong as you only get into battles by your own choice (though sometimes you may get unlucky and get chased down). The world of Dragon Quest XI is incredibly enjoyable due to its quick modes of transport, diverse areas, and the ability to choose what fights you want to get into.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Act 2 is, simply put, phenomenal. There were so many things in this part of the game that I just did not expect at all. One of those things was Hendrik joining your party as a permanent member and apologizing for thinking that the Luminary was evil and chasing him across Erdrea. In retrospect, I feel like I probably should have expected that as Hendrik was never evil and you had an uneven number of party members including yourself, but I digress. In this act the party is initially separated, and you play through each member's specific struggle before meeting them once more, with the exception of the twins, and for a good reason. Without getting too much into it, Veronica died after the events of Act 1 after having used her magic to save everyone. I found this very shocking as this is a Dragon Quest game, and usually every main character gets a happy ending. Instead, this flips the entire script upside down by depressing every party member, especially Serena. This event is pivotal for Serena's growth, as she can no longer follow everything her sister does, and now has to do things for herself. Serena develops into a much stronger person by the end of Act 2 as a result. This act was fantastic because it showed each main character's struggle, development, and because it was full of events that I did not expect to happen.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>In my opinion, Dragon Quest XI, is one of the best JRPGs of all time, if not the best. Every main character in the game is fun to watch in terms of their developments as well as their interactions with others. The world offers plenty of opportunities to explore, and amplifies exploration by providing fast ways to travel as well as optional battles. Act 2 is a masterclass in storytelling, full of things that one would not normally expect from a Dragon Quest game. Dragon Quest XI is a game that I'm truly happy that I spent the time to play because it was so magical.</p>
