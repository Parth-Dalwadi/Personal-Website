				<p>During my childhood, one of my favorite things to do was to play video games. To this day I still play video games very often, and I've finally reached a point where I feel like I've played enough games to make a genuine list of my top 10 favorite games of all time. Throughout this list, I attempted to keep it as diverse as possible by not reusing any video game series unless I deemed it absolutely necessary. I placed this restriction because otherwise my list would be rather boring as it would only be full of The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, and Dragon Quest. Now that the introduction is out of the way, I will be starting with my 10<sup>th</sup> favorite video game of all time!</p>

				<h1 class="video-game-header">10. Hades</h1>
				<img src="images/hades.jpg" alt="Hades" class="video-game-images" style="float: right; clear: both;"/>
				<p>Hades was not a game that I would be expected to have played. I've never been interested in the roguelite genre as I don't see the appeal of doing hundreds of runs without anything of substance occurring such as story progression. However, Hades goes against most roguelites and provides meaningful changes after each of its runs until you've fully completed the story and every side quest. The reason that this is so important is because it incentivizes you to keep playing the game. You play to see what happens to each character, to see how certain situations pan out, and to just see the ending of the game.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Not only does the game make you want to play because of its story, but its gameplay does as well. The controls are essentially five things. You have a default attack for your weapon as well as a secondary attack. Then you have a dash to dodge enemies, a cast which lets you use spells, and a call for a God to assist you. Throughout the run you can enhance each of these parts of your toolkit to become stronger by getting boons from various Gods from Mount Olympus. In the case of the call, it is required that you get a boon first before you can even use it. Each God has their own gimmick which gives you countless combinations that you can try out throughout the game. My overall favorite boons were from Zeus and Dionysus, because I enjoyed how the former became very strong if you kept picking his boons, while the latter was strong if you combined his boons with those of the other Gods. The weapon diversity in the game is pretty good as well, as you have six distinct ones that you can utilize, albeit that you only start with the Stygian Blade and have to unlock the other five. On top of these six weapons, each has three other forms that can be unlocked which changes how you play. Personally speaking, my favorite weapon in the game was the Aspect of Rama, which allows you to shoot in three directions and tag multiple enemies allowing you to damage each tagged enemy by just hitting one. After completing your first ever run, you are able to make the game more difficult with various conditions which creates even more gameplay diversity. The core gameplay is basic, but it works very well due to how much can be changed to keep every run interesting and fun.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Due to Hades being a rougelite, there is a way to permanently increase the capabilities of your character, Zagreus. This can be done by going to Zagreus's bedroom and activating the "Mirror of Night". From here you are able to unlock many different capabilities such as an extra dash, more health, and even a revive when you die. I feel like this was one of the strongest aspects of the game because if you were you still had something to look forward to all the time: upgrading yourself and becoming stronger. This feature was very motivating for me, and helped push me to keep playing until I completed my first ever run. Without this feature, I think that I would either not like this game as much as I do or drop it completely.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Even though I don't typically enjoy the rougelite genre, Hades was a game that completely capitvated me. I enjoyed playing through so I could see the plot and side quests unfold. The gameplay stayed fun the entire time due to the amount of diversity implemented through boons, weapons, and difficulty options. Being able to upgrade your character was the cherry on top to motivate you to keep playing even if you were struggling. Hades is a superb game that I would recommend to anyone as I enjoyed it to completion even though it's from a genre I don't like.</p>

				<h1 class="video-game-header">8. Super Mario Odyssey</h1>
				<img src="images/superMarioOdyssey.jpg" alt="Super Mario Odyssey" class="video-game-images" style="float: right; clear: both;"/>
				<p> Super Mario Odyssey is my favorite Mario game of all time. However, I do have to admit that I have yet to play Super Mario World and Super Mario Galaxy 2. With that said, what I think makes Super Mario Odyssey so great are three major things: the controls of the game, the captures that you use to transform, and the amount of Power Moons to collect.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>The controls of this game allows Mario to be as free as can be in terms of how he moves. Mario's basic movement keeps many staples from previous games such as his long jump, triple jump, and backflip. None of these things are stand out differences from previous games, so why is Mario Odyssey's movement so good? The answer is because of Mario's companion Cappy, who serves as his hat for the game. Cappy allows Mario to do many maneuvers that he previously could not. For example, Mario can now perform a sideways somersault, throw his hat, dive towards his hat, land on his hat, and then roll quickly along the floor in a matter of a few seconds. This makes traversing across all the different areas in the game constantly fun and engaging because you can move so quickly that you don't care if something is really far away.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>A staple of Mario games are the power ups that Mario can use such as the well known Fire Flower. Mario Odyssey takes a very unique approach to Mario's power ups by allowing Mario to transform after capturing an animal, enemy, or object with Cappy. What this allows for is copious amounts of abilities that you can access at any given time from the environment. I think that the greatest strength of this system is the fact that you can make so many power ups without having to create new items. Rather than creating some item that allows you to be a frog, you can capture a frog and become it. This simple mechanic allows the game to become much more diverse than it otherwise would be with Mario's normal power up system.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>The amount of Power Moons in the game is a topic of controversy when it comes to Mario Odyssey. Throughout the game, you are able to collect 880 unique Power Moons, and you need these collectables in order to access different locations in the game. One side says that there are too many and the amount should be reduced, while the other states that the amount of moons is perfectly fine. Personally, I agree with the latter, and in fact think that the decision to have so many moons actually enhances the game. I think that the strongest argument for keeping all of the moons is that it allows for a superior amount of replayability compared to a game with less moons. Once you beat the game and put it down, you can continue collecting hundreds of Power Moons across the various worlds, or you can start a new playthrough and collect the moons in an entirely different order than your first time. It's essential for this game to have as many moons as it does because it incentivizes you play the game more at some point later down the road.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Overall, I think that Super Mario Odyssey is easily Mario's best adventure yet. It has fast-paced action, plenty of unique transformations which act as power ups, and many collectables all over the world. This is a great game that any Mario fan or 3D platforming fan should experience.</p>

				<img src="images/dragonQuestXI.jpg" alt="Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age - Definitive Edition" class="video-game-images" style="float: left; clear: both;"/>
				<p>Dragon Quest XI is a game that I expected to enjoy as I am a fan of the Dragon Quest series. What I did not expect was the fact that everything about it captivated me from the very start of the game.</p>
