				<h1 class="default-header">About Me</h1>
				<p>Hello, my name is Parth Dalwadi, and I made this website to write reviews on my favorite video games and anime of all time while practicing HTML and CSS.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>The first video game I ever played was Pokemon Gold, but I never completed it because, at the time, I was very young and always got lost in an area called the Ice Path. I never actually finished this game because when I got older, I moved on to different ones and because the release of Pokemon HeartGold rendered playing the original pointless for any reason other than novelty's sake. However, I will always have fond memories of it as it's the biggest reason why I continued to play video games throughout my childhood and to now.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>I don't really remember what the first anime I ever watched was. If I had to pick one that was memorable to me as a child, I would say Dragon Ball Z. My favorite memory of this show is the fact that I was so young that I was scared by what was happening; a specific moment I can recall vividly is how Piccolo basically kidnapped Gohan and would train him to be stronger by forcing him in situations where he would have to fend for himself. I was so scared of Piccolo as a child because of this. Like Pokemon Gold, I never finished Dragon Ball Z as a child, but that was because the TV didn't show every episode rather than my incompetence. I don't know if I would say DBZ kickstarted me watching anime, but I will acknowledge that it was one of the first I ever watched and provided me with great memories.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>While it's true that I don't think that highly of the early video games that I played or anime that I watched compared to others that I've experienced, it's equally fact that they shaped my interests and gave me many great memories. Games like Pokemon Gold and anime like Dragon Ball Z will always remain special to me in a way that's different than my favorites of all time; they are precious remnants of my past.</p>
