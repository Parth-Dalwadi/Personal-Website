				<p>Hello, my name is Parth Dalwadi, and I made this website to write reviews on my favorite video games of all time and feature a list of all I've played or want to play while practicing HTML and CSS. I also added a link to a list of all the anime I've ever watched because one day, I might write reviews on some of my favorite anime and because it adds a bit more personality to my website.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>The first video game I ever played was Pokemon Gold, but I never completed it because, at the time, I was very young and always got lost in an area called the Ice Path. I never actually finished this game because when I got older, I moved on to different ones and because the release of Pokemon HeartGold rendered playing the original pointless for any reason other than novelty's sake. However, I will always have fond memories of it as it's the biggest reason why I continued to play video games throughout my childhood and to now.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>While it's true that I don't think that highly of the early video games that I played compared to others that I've experienced, it's equally fact that they shaped my interests and gave me many great memories. Games like Pokemon Gold will always remain special to me in a way that's different than my favorites of all time; they are precious remnants of my past.</p>
