# Parth Dalwadi's Personal Website
This is my personal website that I've made to practice HTML and CSS. I might also add in some JavaScript in the future after learning it.
Here I will write about my ten favorite video games and, potentially later, my ten favorite anime. I've also added links to other websites, such as YouTube, to stylize the website a bit more.
